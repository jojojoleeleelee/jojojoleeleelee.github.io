It's been quite awhile since I've started Flatiron, and I can still recall my initial trepidations:

*Will I make it through?*
*Am I smart enough?*
*How can I succeed?*

I recall my insecurity that manifested in forms of doubt as I questioned if I would be able to finish this curriculum.
Oh, I thought so much. Too much.
Now that I am past my Rails project, I cannot help but smile when I think back on the journey I've come so far. It's staggering how much can happen in a span of just a couple months!
It's exciting to see how much I've grown, how much I've learned and how much I have changed. And to see how much more I will learn in addition to what I have already learned! 
Here are my words of advice for anyone starting out with Flatiron:

1. Enjoy and embrace learning:

This is obvious, but I can't emphasize it enough. Learning to code is just another skillset that requires digging deep and constant learning. You have to become comfortable with the fact that you'll always be a learner, a student in this world of code. 

2. Don't doubt, Go practice:

Instead of doubting, use that time to go practice. It could be watching a Lynda video on JS or Ruby or RSPEC, brushing up on extra coding practice with freecodecamp or Codecademy, reading the MDN or Rails or Ruby docs, reading Stackoverflow... The possibility is endless! You do reap what you sow, though. So go out there and practice! There definitely is no shortage of resources.

3. Stick with a routine - Slow and Steady Wins the Race

Instead of trying to finish something and setting completion as a goal, set learning as a goal. Stick with goals like 'I'm going to learn what Omniauth is today' and make sure you stick to that commitment. Little goals like these will add up in the end, and before you know it, you'll find yourself understanding a lot.

4. Ask, ask, ask!

Use the AAQ! The coaches are the most patient, thoughtful and amazing teachers around. Ask even embarrasing questions. Ask 'em all! Ask slack! Ask google... DM people that are in the same section as yourself. This is a great way to build community and camaraderie and henceforth, motivate you.

5. Make the most out of EVERY opportunity

Go to wework, go to meetups, go to the study groups, read all the documentations, watch the learn.instruction videos... Really. You reap what you sow. Make sure to invest as much as it takes to learn something new! It'll pay off :)
