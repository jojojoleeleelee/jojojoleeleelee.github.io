So, in terms of the ideation process of this last, Magnum Opus - final culmination of my months toiling away at learning web development, I thought of something I would personally need and use. 
So hence the application concept LAMP.

*Your word is a lamp to my feet, a guide to my path. - Psalm 119:105*

Truly, the greatest way to learn to code is through head on building something. 

One huge takeaway is this: 
React is granular to make the composite application or webpage a organized composite. Having small containers and components really help because they can be implemented across pages and routes in such a versatile way. 

The User Interface is clean and easy to follow, especially when Redux stores all the objects across the different components. How convenient to have such a well connected and reliable way to streamline the workflow! If react is the nuggets of data, redux is the communicator/mediator. My Rails API backend is there the composite data components would be stored.

This was my ideation process for this last project for my curriculum -

User visits site - 

Database already has the most beloved verses in the bible by category of emotion that user "need"s: "hope","truth","love", "joy", "peace", "comfort", "faith", "strength"


Seeding the database collection in advance with all of this from the Digital Bible Collection
Components Will Mount on VerseIndex:
how do I save this on the RAILS API Backend? I will have to find a fancy way of data persistence.

Afterwards, the 



One thing I would have done differently though, is this - I started building the client side first. It was sort of awkward, envisioning how the data would run back and forth the api when nothing was there yet. It felt a bit like working backwards - like reading a book from the end.
