It’s pretty surreal, the fact that I am really committing to this. I didn’t see this coming at all say, even a year ago. I think I kind of balked at the idea of sitting in front of a computer all day long, waving my hand at the idea of becoming a ‘millennial techie.’ I suppose I knew very little about what it meant to be a software engineer and even less about the kind of tools and knowlege a software engineer needs to acquire. But after a year of searching, learning, hearing from other software developer friends, I decided to commit because I love learning, building, thinking, problem-solving, exploring. 

In regards to coding, I am beginning to also realize how much I have ahead of me. I’ve been trying to really grasp Javascript the past three (yes, only three) weeks, and the more I learn it, the more I realize how little I know. It’s a very strict language, and it's exhilerating as it is daunting to realize how much was going on behind even the starting google homepage. The amount of things I have left to learn is indeed staggering, but I am also excited for all the possibilities I have in learning these technological tools. I also feel an acute sense of admiration towards well-written code, now. In many ways, coding is so strikingly similar to music. They both require so much focus, creativity, discipline and hard work in order to create the most convincing product. Simple, clean, well-crafted code is really not that different from a touching, powerful performance.

I feel like it is essential to describe my background, so here we go. 
I was a cello performance in my undergrad days, I hauled my cello around everywhere, was obsessed with music and the art of perfection - to me, nothing beat the greats like Beethoven, Schubert, Bach. It's great. I still play the cello and teach cello to students. But I really wanted to learn more, and after a year of freelancing, I have decided to commit to Flatiron's bootcamp. 

And yes, I've had plenty of moments where I questioned myself. Am I going to be able to think like a software engineer? Will I be able to overcome all these mental hurdles?? Isn't it too late for me to start now *after* college!? Am I even fit to do this for a living? I basically doubted every motive and decision I’ve made so far even before I started this coding journey. 
Enough with the questioning, though. It’s time to roll up my sleeves and dig in.
As with learning anything - it's always one problem at a time.
